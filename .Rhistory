#Raw R Code for our data exploration questions:

#-Data Exploration Questions-
#----------------------------
#1. How common are charging stations?
#   Answer: We will use the study in (4) to create a map of charging stations and then analyze the data
#2. What vehicle has the longest excursion time/length on a full-charge?
#   Answer: We will use the study in (3) to analyze this data. Note on electric vehicles:
#   Weather can affect their performance, especially when it's cold.
#3. Which vehicles are the most cost-efficient when compared with traditional ICE cars?
#   Answer: We must find a dataset which discusses these economic factors.
