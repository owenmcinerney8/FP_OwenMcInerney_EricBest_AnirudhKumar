-Potential Data Sources-
------------------------

(1) Jeff Swanson's EV Dataset:
- Includes a wide variety of automobiles
- Data not updated for a long time (Use to compare then and now?)

https://data.world/jeffgswanson/electric-vehicle-by-year

(2) New York State EV Rebate Program Dataset:
- Dataset from a state other than Washington
- Contains other useful information about EV's

https://data.world/data-ny-gov/thd2-fu8y

(3) Washington State EV Database:
- Includes MSRP, excursion time using a full charge, etc
- Most current data thus far

https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2

(4) Data.gov sources:
- Includes information on charging stations

-Data Exploration Questions-
----------------------------
1. (Eric) How common are charging stations? Answer: We will use the study in (4) to create a map of charging stations and then analyze the data

2. (Eric) What vehicle has the longest excursion time/length on a full-charge? Answer: We will use the study in (3) to analyze this data. Note on electric vehicles:
Weather can affect their performance, especially when it's cold.

3. (Eric) Which vehicles are the most cost-efficient when compared with traditional ICE cars? Answer: We must find a dataset which discusses these economic factors.
