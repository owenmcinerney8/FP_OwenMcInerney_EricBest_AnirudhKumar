-Potential Data Sources-
------------------------

(1) Jeff Swanson's EV Dataset:
- Includes a wide variety of automobiles
- Data not updated for a long time (Use to compare then and now?)

https://data.world/jeffgswanson/electric-vehicle-by-year

(2) New York State EV Rebate Program Dataset:
- Dataset from a state other than Washington
- Contains other useful information about EV's

https://data.world/data-ny-gov/thd2-fu8y

(3) Washington State EV Database:
- Includes MSRP, excursion time using a full charge, etc
- Most current data thus far

https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2

(4) Data.gov sources:
- Includes information on charging stations
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-422f2

(5) IEA EV Dataset:
- Includes global EV data by country
- excel file, tidy => need to wrangle data to change cases
https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/global-ev-outlook-2023#global-ev-data

(6) Fueleconomy.gov Sources:
- includes mpge (mile per gallon equivalent) for gas and electric vehicles
- 2024 cars only
- no missing values
- xlsx file

-Data Exploration Questions-
----------------------------
1. (Eric) How common are charging stations in Pennsylvania for public use? Answer: We will use the study in (4) to create a map of charging stations and discuss where they are located in this state.

RELEVANT R CODE FILE: Q1StationMap.R

2. (Owen) What vehicle has the longest excursion time/length on a full-charge? Answer: We will use the study in (3) to analyze this data. Note on electric vehicles:
Weather can affect their performance, especially when it's cold.

RELEVANT R CODE FILE: Q2FuelEconomy.R

3. (VK) How do EV manufacturers compare in excursion range and vehicle price?

RELEVANT R CODE FILE: Q3PriceVsRange.R

4. (Owen) How has global EV usage changed over the years?

RELEVANT R CODE FILE: Q4_5GlobalEVUsage.R

5. (Owen) Which countries lead in EV usage?  Which countries are lagging behind?

RELEVANT R CODE FILE: Q4_5GlobalEVUsage.R

6. (Owen) How do EV MPG compare to Gas MPG?
