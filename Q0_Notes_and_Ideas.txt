-Data Sources-
--------------

(1) Jeff Swanson's EV Dataset:
- Includes a wide variety of automobiles
- Data not updated for a long time (Use to compare then and now?)

https://data.world/jeffgswanson/electric-vehicle-by-year

(2) New York State EV Rebate Program Dataset:
- Dataset from a state other than Washington
- Contains other useful information about EV's

https://data.world/data-ny-gov/thd2-fu8y

(3) Washington State EV Database:
- Includes MSRP, excursion time using a full charge, etc
- Most current data thus far

https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2

(4) Data.gov sources:
- Includes information on charging stations
- Tidied, but includes a lot of irrelevant data

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-422f2

(5) IEA EV Dataset:
- Includes global EV data by country
- excel file, tidy => need to wrangle data to change cases

https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/global-ev-outlook-2023#global-ev-data

(6) Fueleconomy.gov Sources:
- includes mpge (mile per gallon equivalent) for gas and electric vehicles
- 2024 cars only
- no missing values
- xlsx file

https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml

- history of electric cars

https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-electric-car

(7) Bureau of Labor Statistics:
 - costs of gas and electricity
